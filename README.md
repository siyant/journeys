# journeys

Wouldnâ€™t it be great if you could take an express bus from your house directly to your workplace and back every day, with close to zero stops in between? 

By comparing origin-destination data of road users with rail users, we seek to discover journeys that occur at high frequency at a certain time period, and that are faster on road than on rail. From our analysis, we will propose potential express bus routes to send passengers directly from end to end. This alternative option will not only reduce congestion, but also offer commuters a smoother, faster and more comfortable ride.
